The most common type is the red imported fire ant. Red imported fire ants live in colonies. First, they nest in the ground. They are usually found wherever there is grass. However, some fire ants create nests in the walls of buildings. As they build the colony, they create a mound of dirt over the nest. The mound can grow up to eighteen inches high and over two feet wide."

The Gulf Stream influences the climate of the east coast of North America from Florida to Newfoundland, and the west coast of Europe. Its extension toward Europe, called the North Atlantic drift, makes Western Europe, and especially Northern European winters, considerably warmer than they otherwise would be."
